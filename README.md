# Starscape-Module
The following Python Module is an Astronomy repository using ideas of Image Segmentation to filter/contour out images of stars from star clusters or any Astronomical data clicked by professional telescopes based on the brightness of stars, redshift and temperature. It hosts a temperature database that maps a temperature in Kelvin to a well calibrated RGB value.
